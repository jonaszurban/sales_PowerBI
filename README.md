# sales_PowerBI
Small project based on Power BI technology. Mainly creating data model, measures and visualisations. Based on fictional sales data. Only for learning purposes. All data available in xlsx file called SalesData (attached to this repository).
Main goal of project was to show efficiency of employees in fictional company, depending on year, quarter, month or product. 
First task was to optymalize tables with Power Query (merging queries to get correct columns) and create data model between tables. Then I created calculated column in Sales table called AmountOfCommision to calculate commision earned in every trade for future measures. Column is based on CALCULATE and FILTER functions.
Then was created all measures used in visualisations. The last step was creating visualisations and adding slicers to make dashboard more interactive.
